Description
This is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot, following best practices and modern development principles. The project provides a robust backend for [briefly describe the purpose of your application, e.g., managing users, products, or other resources], leveraging Spring technologies and a MySQL database.
Adopted Practices

SOLID: Ensuring clean, maintainable, and scalable code through single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion principles.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoiding code duplication to improve maintainability.
YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Implementing only the necessary features to keep the codebase lean.
KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prioritizing simplicity in design and implementation.
API REST: Adhering to RESTful principles for stateless, scalable, and intuitive API design.
Spring Data JPA Queries: Simplifying database operations with Spring Data JPA repositories.
Dependency Injection: Using Spring's IoC container for loose coupling and easier testing.
Error Handling: Consistent and meaningful error responses for better client experience.
Swagger Documentation: Automatically generated API documentation using SpringDoc OpenAPI 3.

Technologies Used

Spring Boot: Framework for rapid application development and simplified configuration.
Spring MVC: Handling HTTP requests and responses in a structured manner.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifying data access with JPA-based repositories.
SpringDoc OpenAPI 3: Generating interactive API documentation with Swagger UI.
MySQL: Relational database for persistent storage.
